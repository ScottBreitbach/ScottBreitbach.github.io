# Categorization of Beans using Machine Learning
Multiclass [classification of 7 bean species](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/blob/main/Portfolio-Projects/Beans-Classification/Beans-Classification.ipynb) based on measurements. Includes EDA, visualization, 
standardization, [feature selection](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/blob/main/Portfolio-Projects/Beans-Classification/Feature-selection.ipynb), and evaluation of several models, including [hyperparameter tuning](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/blob/main/Portfolio-Projects/Beans-Classification/Hyperparameter-tuning.ipynb).
