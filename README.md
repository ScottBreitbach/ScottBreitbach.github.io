# Welcome to **Scott's** Portfolio

I am a Biologist and budding Data Scientist versed in Machine Learning and Data Visualization using Python, R, Power BI

## Portfolio

- [Cornhusker Football and Public Safety](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/tree/main/Portfolio-Projects/Football-Safety)
 - Use R for analysis of crime and traffic incidents in Lincoln, NE on Cornhusker game weekends compared to non-game weekends.
- [Nebraska Breweries](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/tree/main/Portfolio-Projects/NE-Breweries)
 - Use Python for scraping tables on the web to collect data. Cleaning data and combining using SQL joins. Standardization of addresses and phone numbers, and geographic mapping of brewery locations.
- [Immigration Ancestry and Income](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/tree/main/Portfolio-Projects/Income-Ancestry)
 - Python analysis to determine whether having grandparents born outside of the US impacts the income of an individual or family.
- [Bean Classification using ML](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/tree/main/Portfolio-Projects/Beans-Classification)
 - Multiclass classification of 7 bean species based on measurements. Includes EDA, visualization, standardization, feature selection, and evaluation of several models, including hyperparameter tuning.
- [Housing Price Modeling](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/tree/main/Portfolio-Projects/Housing-Prices)
 - Use R for analysis of several predictive models of housing prices using groups of features generated previously through feature selection methods in Python.
- [Airline Safety Infographic](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/tree/main/Portfolio-Projects/Airline-Infographic)
 - Infographic demonstrating the safety of flight as a travel option, from the perspective of an airline customer.
- [AI Text Generation](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/tree/main/Portfolio-Projects/Text-Generation)
 - Implement LSTM text generator with Tensorflow and Keras using Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy corpus.
- [Microbe Identification](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/tree/main/Portfolio-Projects/Microbe-Identification)
 - Use of Machine Learning in Python for automated classification of microbes from an imbalanced dataset to aid in rapid identification of microbes.
- [Stroke Prediction](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/tree/main/Portfolio-Projects/Stroke-Prediction)
 - Binary classification in Python to predict stroke in patients using Machine Learning with patient data. Includes multiple model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and model ensembles.
- [Airline Safety Dashboard](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/tree/main/Portfolio-Projects/Airline-Dashboard)
 - Use of Power BI for interactive dashboard showing summary of airline flights and accidents over time and by flight type, aircraft type, and location.


## About Me

I wasn't always in love with science, but when I had to take a biology course (required to wrap up my business degree) I was set on a new path. I extended my university stay a couple more years, following a newfound fascination though pursuit of a biotechnology degree. This got me a job in the sciences, where I've spent almost 20 years, first in quality testing and then on to vaccine development and production.

In the interim, I continued to explore other paths: becoming a master gardener, learning about prairie management, taking up beekeeping, and trying my hand at brewing beer and even mead.

Eventually I came to a realization that not everyone loves playing around with spreadsheets as much as I do. That, coupled with a general penchant for technology, presented me an opportunity in the form of data science. So at the same time the pandemic was ramping up, I began taking classes, ultimately wrapping up a Masters in Data Science in August 2022.

Now it's time to see where these new tools might lead me.
